## Introduction

This project aims to analyze financial news datasets to uncover trends and insights using different analytical approaches. The toolkit includes various modules to perform:

- Descriptive statistics
- Text analysis (sentiment detection and word cloud generation)
- Time series analysis (publication frequency and patterns)
- Publisher-specific analysis (publisher insights and domain extraction)

---

## Project Setup

Ensure you have the necessary files and modules in place before running the code.

- Your dataset should be placed in the `../data/` directory with the filename `financial_news.csv`.
- The project is organized into custom modules located under the `modules/` folder.

---

## Data Loading

To analyze financial news, the dataset is loaded as a Pandas DataFrame from the following path:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Path to the dataset
file_path = '../data/financial_news.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
```

Ensure your dataset contains relevant columns such as:

- **`headline`**
- **`publisher`**
- **`date`**

---

## Modules

### Descriptive Statistics

Analyzing basic statistics and trends related to news headlines and publishers.

```python
# Basic statistics about headlines
print(basic_statistics(df, 'headline'))

# Number of articles per publisher
articles_per_publisher(df, 'publisher')

# Trends in news publication over time
publication_trends(df, 'date')
```

- **`basic_statistics(df, column)`**: Provides fundamental statistics for a specified column.
- **`articles_per_publisher(df, column)`**: Analyzes the distribution of articles across publishers.
- **`publication_trends(df, column)`**: Visualizes publication trends based on date or another time-related column.

---

### Text Analysis

Analyzing sentiment and generating visual insights from headlines.

```python
# Sentiment analysis for headlines
df = sentiment_analysis(df, 'headline')

# Generate a word cloud from headlines
generate_wordcloud(df, 'headline')
```

- **`sentiment_analysis(df, column)`**: Detects sentiment patterns (positive, neutral, negative) in news headlines.
- **`generate_wordcloud(df, column)`**: Creates a word cloud for visualizing frequently occurring words in headlines.

---

### Time Series Analysis

Exploring trends in news publication frequency and timing.

```python
# Analyzing publication frequency trends
publication_frequency(df, 'date')

# Analyzing publishing times patterns
publishing_times_analysis(df, 'date')
```

- **`publication_frequency(df, column)`**: Provides insights into the frequency of news publications.
- **`publishing_times_analysis(df, column)`**: Identifies patterns in news publication times.

---

### Publisher Analysis

Extracting publisher-specific insights and domain extraction.

```python
# Analyzing publishers in the dataset
publisher_analysis(df, 'publisher')

# Extracting domains associated with publishers
extract_domains(df, 'publisher')
```

- **`publisher_analysis(df, column)`**: Offers insights into publisher distributions and contributions.
- **`extract_domains(df, column)`**: Extracts domains from publisher names to identify sources of news.

## Running the Code

1. Ensure you have the dataset placed in the `../data/` directory with the name `financial_news.csv`.
2. Run your Python script or interactive environment.
3. Execute the provided code snippets step by step to analyze various aspects of the dataset.

Example script flow:

```python
# Load Data
import pandas as pd
file_path = '../data/financial_news.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Perform Descriptive Statistics
print(basic_statistics(df, 'headline'))
articles_per_publisher(df, 'publisher')

# Conduct Text Analysis
df = sentiment_analysis(df, 'headline')
generate_wordcloud(df, 'headline')

# Analyze Time Series Data
publication_frequency(df, 'date')
publishing_times_analysis(df, 'date')

# Publisher-specific Analysis
publisher_analysis(df, 'publisher')
extract_domains(df, 'publisher')
```

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Other dependencies required by your custom modules located in the `modules/` folder.

Install Pandas if it's not already installed:

```bash
pip install pandas
```
